# Grid Penguin

- **Simulator**: to create a model to simulate the physical district heating networks
  - **CHP**: model of the CHP (combined heat and prower production unit). Contains the files in such hierarchy:
    - CHP.py: main file
    - FOR_bloess.py: feasible operation region from [Bloess 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261920302397)
    - FOR_keypts.py: feasible operation region constructed from key points
    - storage.py: model of the heat storage
    - make_params.py: adjust parameters here
  - **Grid**: model of the heating network.
    - **Case**: examples of network construction
      - one_consumer.py: network with one producer, one consumer and two pipes
      - small.py: (outdated)
      - large.py: grid with one producer, 4 HX (heat exchange station) and 800 consumers (outdated)
    - **Model**: building blocks of the network
      - grid.py: container for all nodes and edges
      - producer.py: production unit (CHP is also a producer, but here the producer is modeled much simplified)
      - consumer.py: end consumer that has heat demand
      - edge.py: water pipes
      - transfer.py: HX
    - **Wanda_compare**: to build dummy grid and compare performance with Wanda
